Our input is from [Exploring Demographic Language Variations to Improve Multilingual Sentiment Analysis in Social Media (Volkova, Wilson, & Yarowsky, 2013)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~svitlana/papers/VWY-emnlp2013.pdf) and can be downloaded [here](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~svitlana/data/data_emnlp2013.tar.gz). See [this link](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-09-14-twitter-data)) for how to fetch the (English) tweets.

Tagging was done using [TweeboParser](https://github.com/ikekonglp/TweeboParser), and [Google Books English 1-grams](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html) were used to approximate true frequency distributions.
